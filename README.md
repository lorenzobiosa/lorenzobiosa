I work on **secure, scalable platforms** and **intelligent automation systems**.

My focus is on designing **enterprise-grade architectures** for hybrid and multi-cloud environments, with strong emphasis on **security-by-design**, **automation**, and **operational reliability**.

I’m particularly interested in building systems that are **deterministic, observable, and resilient by default**, reducing operational complexity through well-designed platforms and automation.

Much of my work sits at the intersection of **cloud infrastructure**, **platform engineering**, and **agentic AI**, with a constant focus on long-term sustainability and trust.
